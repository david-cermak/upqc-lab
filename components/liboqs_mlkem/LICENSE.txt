SUMMARY
=======

This component combines:
1. Port layer code (Apache 2.0) - ESP-IDF integration and wrapper
2. liboqs library (MIT License) - unified post-quantum cryptography API
3. Kyber reference implementation (Public Domain OR Apache 2.0) - cryptographic primitives

All licenses are compatible, allowing the combined work to be distributed.
The port layer is licensed under Apache 2.0 to ensure compatibility with ESP-IDF
and the Kyber reference implementation's Apache 2.0 option.
