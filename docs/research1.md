# Post-Quantum Cryptography: Methods, Tools, and Implementation for Embedded Systems

Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) has emerged as a critical security technology as organizations prepare for the quantum computing threat. With NIST's finalization of the first PQC standards in August 2024, the field is rapidly transitioning from research to practical implementation, particularly in embedded systems and edge devices where resource constraints present unique challenges.[^1]

## Current PQC Methods and Standards

The cryptographic landscape has been transformed by NIST's selection of four primary algorithms for standardization. The finalized standards include:[^2][^3]

**FIPS 203 (ML-KEM)**: Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism, derived from CRYSTALS-Kyber, serves as the primary standard for general encryption. ML-KEM offers three parameter sets with varying security levels and key sizes ranging from 800 to 1,952 bytes for public keys.[^2]

**FIPS 204 (ML-DSA)**: Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Algorithm based on CRYSTALS-Dilithium provides robust digital signatures for authentication and data integrity.[^3][^2]

**FIPS 205 (SLH-DSA)**: Stateless Hash-Based Digital Signature Algorithm derived from SPHINCS+ offers an alternative mathematical approach as a backup to lattice-based schemes.[^3]

**FIPS 206 (FN-DSA)**: Based on the FALCON algorithm, this standard is expected to be finalized by late 2024.[^1]

These standards represent five main mathematical approaches to quantum-resistant cryptography: lattice-based, code-based, hash-based, isogeny-based, and multivariate cryptography. Lattice-based algorithms dominate due to their balance of security, performance, and manageable key sizes.[^1]

## Available Tools and Libraries

Several mature libraries and tools support PQC implementation across different platforms:

**Open Quantum Safe (OQS)** project provides the most comprehensive toolkit. The liboqs library offers a unified C API for quantum-resistant algorithms, supporting all NIST-selected standards plus alternative candidates. OQS provides integration with OpenSSL through oqs-provider and includes bindings for Python, Rust, and Java.[^4]

**Commercial Library Support** varies significantly across platforms. A 2025 survey revealed that wolfSSL/wolfCrypt leads with strong early PQC support, while OpenSSL is incorporating algorithms with ongoing integration. Bouncy Castle offers implementations for Java and C\#, and Botan provides versatile PQC support.[^5][^6]

**Hardware Vendor Solutions** are emerging rapidly. STMicroelectronics has integrated PQC algorithms into general-purpose MCUs and secure microcontrollers through the X-CUBE-PQC software library. IDEMIA Secure Transactions announced advanced post-quantum hardware accelerators based on Keccak in March 2025.[^7][^8]

## Embedded Systems Implementation Challenges

### Resource Constraints

PQC algorithms impose significant resource requirements compared to classical cryptography. Memory usage represents the most critical constraint - while ECC requires only ~32 bytes for keys, ML-KEM-768 needs 1,184 bytes for public keys and up to 2,400 bytes for complete secret keys. Fast implementations of ML-DSA can consume 50 KiB of RAM, problematic for devices with as little as 8-16 KiB available.[^9]

### Performance Impact

Embedded systems face substantial computational overhead when implementing PQC. While lattice-based KEMs like Kyber can run faster than ECDH by at least one order of magnitude as primitives, signature schemes impose greater burdens. Post-Quantum TLS protocols using Kyber-SPHINCS+ cipher suites introduce significant latency and memory usage, primarily due to signature computation costs.[^10][^11]

Research on Cortex-M4 platforms shows varied performance characteristics. Raspberry Pi 4 requires 100-300 microseconds for Kyber and SABER main functions, while lattice-based signatures demand more computational resources. However, Dilithium and Falcon power consumption matches RSA-4096 levels, indicating reasonable energy efficiency.[^11][^10]

### Hardware Acceleration Needs

Dedicated hardware acceleration for PQC remains limited. While existing cryptographic hardware for hash functions can support schemes like ML-DSA and SLH-DSA, optimal performance requires specialized PQC co-processors. The development cycle for such hardware spans multiple years, creating a gap between software availability and hardware optimization.[^9]

## Practical Migration Strategies

### Hybrid Approaches

Hybrid cryptography combines traditional and PQC algorithms to hedge against both classical and quantum attacks. For key exchange, this involves combining ML-KEM with ECDH using key derivation functions. Digital signatures require dual signing with both classical and PQC schemes, with verification succeeding only when both signatures validate.[^9]

### Cryptographic Agility

Cryptographic agility enables systems to easily update cryptographic algorithms without major architectural changes. This approach is expensive for resource-constrained devices but critical for long-lived embedded systems. Implementation requires standardized interfaces, firmware update capabilities, and hardware roots of trust to prevent security downgrades.[^9]

### Edge Computing Offloading

Novel approaches leverage edge computing to address IoT device limitations. Framework designs allow devices to offload cryptographic tasks to post-quantum edge servers while maintaining local capabilities for critical operations. This hybrid approach integrates physical-layer security techniques like wiretap coding for additional protection.[^12]

## Hardware Acceleration Developments

The hardware acceleration landscape for PQC is rapidly evolving. Specialized accelerators focus on polynomial multiplication, the most computationally intensive PQC operation. Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) implementations reduce computational complexity from O(nÂ²) to O(n log n), making lattice-based schemes more feasible.[^10]

Recent developments include RISC-V instruction set extensions for polynomial operations and ARM Neon technology optimizations achieving 15-65% performance improvements in Falcon operations. FPGA implementations demonstrate significant speedups, though energy consumption remains a concern for battery-powered devices.[^10]

## Market Outlook and Migration Timelines

The PQC market is experiencing explosive growth, valued at \$297.82 million in 2024 and projected to reach \$2.49 billion by 2030 with a 42.5% CAGR. This growth is driven by increasing awareness of quantum threats, government mandates, and the "harvest now, decrypt later" attack vector where adversaries collect encrypted data for future quantum decryption.[^13]

### Government Migration Timelines

Multiple governments have established concrete migration schedules:[^14][^15]

**United Kingdom**: Organizations must complete discovery phases by 2028, high-priority migrations by 2031, and full transitions by 2035.[^14]

**Canada**: Federal departments must develop migration plans by April 2026, complete high-priority system migrations by end of 2031, and finish remaining systems by 2035.[^15]

**United States**: CNSA 2.0 sets aggressive timelines with exclusive use requirements ranging from 2025 for software/firmware signing to 2033 for legacy equipment.[^9]

### Industry Adoption Patterns

The migration follows a tiered approach with critical infrastructure, finance, and defense sectors leading adoption. Early adopters focus on protecting long-lived sensitive data against future quantum attacks. The 2025-2028 period represents a crucial transition phase where organizations must complete cryptographic asset inventories and begin high-priority migrations.[^13]

## Specific Considerations for Edge Devices

### IoT and Sensor Networks

IoT devices present unique PQC challenges due to extreme resource constraints and long deployment lifecycles. Many devices lack update mechanisms or sufficient resources for PQC implementation. Solutions include pre-shared symmetric keys for limited-scale deployments and gateway-based protection where edge devices handle PQC operations on behalf of constrained sensors.[^16]

### Automotive and Industrial Systems

Safety-critical embedded systems require careful PQC integration to maintain real-time performance guarantees. Automotive applications benefit from hybrid approaches where time-critical operations use classical cryptography with PQC providing long-term protection for firmware integrity and over-the-air updates.[^9]

## Future Outlook and Recommendations

The PQC landscape will continue evolving rapidly through 2030. Key trends include standardization of additional algorithms, improved hardware acceleration, and mature migration tools. Organizations should begin cryptographic asset discovery immediately, prioritizing systems with long data lifespans or critical security functions.

For embedded system developers, the focus should be on cryptographic agility, hybrid implementations, and collaboration with hardware vendors to ensure PQC readiness. The window for proactive migration is narrowing - with quantum computers potentially arriving in the early 2030s, organizations must act decisively to protect their digital infrastructure against future quantum threats.[^9]

The transition to post-quantum cryptography represents both a significant technical challenge and an opportunity to strengthen overall security postures. Success requires coordinated efforts across the entire technology stack, from algorithm research to hardware implementation, ensuring that tomorrow's embedded systems remain secure in the quantum computing era.
